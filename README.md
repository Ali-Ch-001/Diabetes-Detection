# Diabetes Detection

## Description
This project aims to detect diabetes in patients using machine learning algorithms. The dataset used contains various medical predictor variables and one target variable indicating whether or not a patient has diabetes. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the presence of diabetes based on the input features.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms.
- Model evaluation and comparison.
- Hyperparameter tuning for the best model.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ali-Ch-001/Diabetes-Detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Diabetes-Detection
   ```
3. (Optional) Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project can be found in the `data` directory. It includes various medical predictor variables such as glucose level, blood pressure, insulin level, BMI, age, etc., and a target variable indicating the presence of diabetes.

## Usage
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Diabetes-Detection
   ```
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Open and run the `diabetes_detection.ipynb` notebook to see the data analysis, model training, and evaluation process.

### Steps
- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understand the data distribution and relationships.
- **Model Implementation**: Train various machine learning models.
- **Model Evaluation**: Compare the performance of different models.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the best-performing model.
